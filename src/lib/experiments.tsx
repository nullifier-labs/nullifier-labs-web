          The zkTLS Weather demo showcases how zero-knowledge proofs can be used to verify real-world data 
          without revealing the underlying information. This project demonstrates proving that the weather 
          temperature is above a specific threshold without exposing the exact temperature or location.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Using zkTLS (zero-knowledge Transport Layer Security), we can create cryptographic proofs about 
          data fetched from weather APIs while maintaining privacy. This opens up possibilities for 
          conditional payments, insurance claims, and other applications that depend on verifiable real-world data.
