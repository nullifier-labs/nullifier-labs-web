I want to create a "zero knowledge labs" company. In this company I want to do a lot of zk experiments. Initially just for fun and see what I can do, but eventually I hope to get some funding to do more commercial stuff. 

Creative Directions / Ideas
Experiments
ZK Toys: Mini zk-apps (games, puzzles, voting tools)

Proof of Mystery: zk-based ARGs or time-locked puzzles (like WhispersInCode)

zkSocial: Private social graph / reputation prototypes

Zero Knowledge IDE: Tooling for building/verifying zk circuits

zkInfra: Experiments in proving infra like zk light clients, rollups, bridges

Themes
Open Source First – build in public, attract community

Storytelling via zk – puzzles, time capsules, secret messages

Grants + Hackathons – build fun zk stuff, use that to apply for grants (EF, ZKValidator, etc.)

Crossover with AI – zkML, private inference, verification of LLM claims
